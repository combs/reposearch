# reposearch
A little helper shell script for searching repositories.

Yeah, Atom/whatever can do it, but this is mad fast.

## Installation

Add files to somewhere in your $PATH, perhaps `/usr/local/bin`

## Usage

```
reposearch [terms]
reposearch [grep arguments] [terms]
```

```
repoindex 
# uses base dir of $PWD repo

repoindex [repo base dir]
```

## Future improvements

- Automatically reindex after X days
